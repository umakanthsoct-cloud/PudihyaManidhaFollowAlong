# Digital Cognitive Twin (Early Draft)

This repository documents the **early working draft** of a Digital Cognitive Twin application.

This is a *learning-in-public* project focused on system architecture, cognition-oriented design, and real-world constraints rather than polished production code.

> Status: **Working draft exists and runs locally**

## Why this project
- Explore how cognitive systems can be architected
- Learn AI implementation from a systems-thinking lens
- Share challenges, trade-offs, and learnings openly

## Disclaimer
This project is experimental and evolving. Expect rough edges.

## Getting Started
See `TECH_STACK.md` and `QUICKSTART.md` (coming soon).
