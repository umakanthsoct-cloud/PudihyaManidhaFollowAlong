# Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular, layered architecture:

## Core Components
- Interaction Loop (input → reasoning → response)
- Memory subsystem (short-term & long-term)
- Reasoning & orchestration layer
- Tooling / integrations layer

## Design Principles
- Architecture before optimization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Observability over magic

This document will evolve as the system matures.
