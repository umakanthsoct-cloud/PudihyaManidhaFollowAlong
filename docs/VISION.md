# Vision

The goal of this project is to build a **Digital Cognitive Twin** — a system that mirrors aspects of human cognition such as memory, reasoning, and contextual understanding.

## What this is
- A persistent, evolving cognitive system
- Memory-aware and context-sensitive
- Designed with architecture-first principles
- PII masking techniques can be used to protect sensitive information when sending data to external LLMs
- Integrated with tools to perform actions in the real world

## What this is not
- Just a chatbot
- A prompt-only experiment
- A production-ready AI assistant

The focus is on *thinking systems*, not demos.
